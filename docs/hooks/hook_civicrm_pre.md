# hook_civicrm_pre

## Summary

This hook is called before a db write on some core objects.

## Notes

This hook does not allow the abort of the operation, use a form hook instead.

We suspect the pre hook will be useful for developers building more
complex applications and need to perform operations before CiviCRM takes
action. This is very applicable when you need to maintain foreign key
constraints etc (when deleting an object, the child objects have to be
deleted first). Another good use for the pre hook is to see what is
changing between the old and new data.
